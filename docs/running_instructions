Steps to run the code

CLIENT NODES
1. Set up 4 client nodes by running
	
	=> python3 node.py <port_number>

on four different terminal screens.


WORKER NODES
1. python3 main.py

Running this file will take you to a command line structure. You will have to send commands in real time to see outputs
Following are the formats for the commands

-> command : crawl
-> Enter Website : <website>
-> Enter Level : <level>


-> command : make_graph
-> Enter Website : <website>
-> Enter Depth : <depth>

-> command : html
-> Enter Website : <website>

-> command : End ( This will close the main.py file )

PS : Note that closing the main.py will NOT lead to loosing the data that we got from crawling. That will persist for as long as the nodes are running

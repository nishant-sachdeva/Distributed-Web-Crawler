1. Make a virtual environment for working
	==> virtualenv -p python3 env <==

=> If a requirements.txt file is already present, we can install those dependencies using the following command 
	==> pip3 install -r requirements.txt <==

2. The name "env" has been added to the .gitignore, so that the repo is not unnecessarily bloated.

3. Before committing , please run the following command : 
	==> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt  <==

4. Other commit instructions are the same as the standard ones. Primary aim of these instructions is to ensure consistency of environments.

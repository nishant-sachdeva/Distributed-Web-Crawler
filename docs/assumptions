ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE CODE:

1. we assume 4 worker nodes/clients which run on ports immediately succeeding port 5000.(5001, 5002, 5003, 5004)
	
	-> These said ports will have to entered as arguments when the nodes are run.

2. The number of worker nodes that we are starting with can be changed, easily by making a trivial change in the code.
 ( A tutorial for the same shall be given in the demo submission ).

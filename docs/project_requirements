There are two types of requirements:

1. crawl(depth, url)
2. show_html(url)
3. show_graph(url, depth)
4. page_rank(url)

Points to be noted
1. Storage across different clients has to be independent of each other. We need to generate a compiled output on run time of a query
2. We assume no failure of clients

BONUS REQUIREMENTS
1. Multiple clients are on different systems
2. update(url) :: checks if the page has updated ,and if it has, fetches it and updates the graph
